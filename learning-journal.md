### Reflect on Chapter 2 of DDS

Wow big data huh. I think the most interesting topic raised in this chapter was the idea of data no longer be a sample.  Before it was too costly and would take too long to survey everyone so everything was based on random samples. But what about now? Still out of reach of asking everyone but it's certainly much closer in feasibility. So what happens when it's no longer a random sample but in fact the whole population?

Well it turns out it is still helpful to treat it as a random sample.

### Reflect on the Bridge exercise we did first day of class

#### Record three words
My words would definetely change now.  I think my first three words I was just kind of going off buzz words. It was a list of things people say about data science not what it is. I think I would go with more a progression like what was presented in ISLR chap 2. -- generalized linear regression, computation power, accesible to the masses (I know those aren't really words)

#### Phase 2: ask a question
What is an Advanced data science topic? -- This is still a revelent question I have.  Do we split it on types of algortims or our understanding of algortihms.

#### New Question
What is random?

## 3/30/20

This was a crazy semester before all of the added events of the past 3 weeks.  I feel like I was satisfied for the situation with sticking to my learning goals. I think where I was falling behind, was not in consuming external sources, but failing to take the time to summarize and share. I also stil continue to suffer from procrastination so submitting at or past the deadline.  I have been keeping up with and reading which is usually a problem for me so I will end with that little pat on the back.
