### Reflect on Chapter 2 of DDS

Wow big data huh. I think the most interesting topic raised in this chapter was the idea of data no longer be a sample.  Before it was too costly and would take too long to survey everyone so everything was based on random samples. But what about now? Still out of reach of asking everyone but it's certainly much closer in feasibility. So what happens when it's no longer a random sample but in fact the whole population?

Well it turns out it is still helpful to treat it as a random sample.

## Class 12 

### Reflect on the Bridge exercise we did first day of class

#### Record three words
My words would definitely change now.  I think my first three words I was just kind of going off buzz words. It was a list of things people say about data science not what it is. I think I would go with more a progression like what was presented in ISLR chap 2. -- generalized linear regression, computation power, accessible to the masses (I know those aren't really words)

#### Phase 2: ask a question
What is an Advanced data science topic? -- This is still a relevent question I have.  Do we split it on types of algorithms or our understanding of algorithms.

#### New Question
What is random?

## 3/30/20

This was a crazy semester before all of the added events of the past 3 weeks.  I feel like I was satisfied for the situation with sticking to my learning goals. I think where I was falling behind, was not in consuming external sources, but failing to take the time to summarize and share. I also still continue to suffer from procrastination so submitting at or past the deadline.  I have been keeping up with and reading which is usually a problem for me so I will end with that little pat on the back.


### Final Bridge

Words change over the semester they are just bits still not accomplishing to characterize the whole of Data Science. What is Data Science? Critical thinking, deep exploration, impartial reporting

I don' think my question could ever be definitively answered but more me I draw the distinction at advanced communication of ideas that is important.

I still like my analogy so I'll keep it

I use to think advanced data science meant fancy algorithms and crazy math.  Now I think it's about your understanding and communication of those ideas.

I'm glad I learned how to work together in a data science team with various levels of skill and backgrounds.
I wished I had learned

* What does the model of algorithms presented so far tell us about social media?
  * Social media is society driven by algorithms. They want you to stay on their site so the are constantly trying to in-tune what will captivate you. Unfortunately, this just creates a "echo chamber" of ideas and thoughts you already agree with and many of us are no longer challenged in our views to the extent we once were.
  
* Have you had experiences with big data that O’Neil’s account illuminates?
  * In my job I have worked with big data before. The biggest take away I have from working with big data is at a certain point you are no longer feasibly able to determine what is truth and what is not.You have to trust your software systems and skills that you are getting an accurate representation of the truth.
  
* What would it take for an education algorithm to meet all of O’Neil’s criteria for not doing damage?
  * I think in order to meet the criteria the model presented would have to put less emphasis on standardize testing scores. I also think have entrance and exit examines would have helped with the problem of cheating that the author brought up in the first chapter.
  
* What are the best ways to address the problem of “false positives”, of exceptionally bad results, of anomalies?
 * I think it is important especially for important result to not let that be a final answer. When someone is given a terminal illness the first thing a doctor will tell them is to get a second opinion. We can utilize data models to help us but it should be seen as another input to the human decision making process not the output.


### Weapons of Math Desruction #2


* If creating or running a WMD is so profitable, how can we push back against them?
  * WMD's are profitable because they are a distillation of what are greatest minds have to offer.  However, there is often a lot of hubris that comes attached to that. It is important for all of us to pursue working for companies that align with our personal beliefs. I have had jobs where I had to make choices I wouldn't have made myself and it has always been a detriment. We can see this in the author's own story as well. Disillusioned by the errors of her colleagues. We must fight with our time and our dollar. Be sure to not support organizations which use these WMD's.
  
* Do you find other university ranking schemes to be preferable to the US News one, either personally or within this book’s argument?
  * I think the best judge of a college is the employment rate and starting salaries of graduates. We all come to university to launch us into our next chapter in life.  How far your school can launch you should be the ultimate examination of success.
  
* At one point the author suggests that gaming the US News ranking might not be bad for a university, as “most of the proxies… reflect a school’s overall quality to some degree” (58). Do you agree?
  * I think generally any gaming of a system is bad. When organizations look for shortcuts to their issues it signals an underlying lack of care and devotion to the organization's mission.

### Weapons of Math Desruction #3

* Are there advertising campaigns using big data that avoid these problems?
  * I think the idea of personalized ads are at worse benign and can sometime be helpful. First the type of advertising Facebook, amazon and Google do is fairly harmless to us overall. I like buying useful things and it's a big world out there. The better these companies get at putting items I'm interested in front of me the happier we both are. But this also assume sufficient self-control on the recipient end of the advertising.
  
* If non-profit higher education competition heats up, will those campuses turn to these sorts of big data campaigns?
  * I think that we could see non-profit education turn to these sort of tactics if competition for students gets bad enough. The Harvard and Stanford of the world will be fine for a long time with their multi-billion dollar endowments. However, from the previous chapter we see everyone in the middle already working to game the ranking system, to get more students. With the easy ability of accessing student loans this behavior could become very predator seeing as only about 40% of students graduate from college.
  
* Mark Wilson asks a powerful question. If all data massively collected in America is biased, how should we proceed?
  * I think we have seen in many aspect of life the more diverse voices you have on a project the more holistic the solution becomes. We need to have inclusion where contributors feel equal and free to express their opinions. One of the biggest proponents to the bias is a data scientist vastly look alike, and STEM as a whole has diversity issues.
